# MEARN Stack App with GraphQL API <img src="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/master/resources/GraphQL%20Logo.svg" width="50" />
- Database: MongoDB
- Back-end API: Apollo Server (built on Express) with Node.js
- Front-end: React with Apollo Client

Authentication using JSON Web Tokens and Apollo Client Cache to store fetched results on frontend. Built with React Hooks (including apollo hooks) and the Semantic UI Library. This can be used to create various different applications with a data from a backend database and/or other Servers/APIs.

### To-Do: 
- ~~create post component with authentication if jwt expired~~
- make createPost display straightaway
- pagination on front-end??

Based on a similar project I did using python: [Graphene-Flask-API](https://github.com/MrYKenz/Graphene-Flask-API)
