# MEARN Stack App with GraphQL API <img src="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/master/resources/GraphQL%20Logo.svg" width="50" />
- Database: MongoDB
- Back-end API: Apollo Server (built on Express) with Node.js
- Front-end: React with Apollo Client

Authentication using JSON Web Tokens and Apollo Client Cache to store fetched results on frontend. Built with React Hooks (including apollo hooks) and the Semantic UI Library. This can be used to create various different applications with a local backend database and other Server / API Data.

Based on a similar project I did using python: [Graphene-Flask-API](https://github.com/MrYKenz/Graphene-Flask-API)
